GESHEFT (Grand Expansion of Ships, Historical Equipment, Focuses and Technologies) - is a project to improve the realism in HOI 4, starting with icons and names of the equipment and (WIP) by expanding the tech tree and focus tree through the timeline (to 1980s) as well as in complexity (introducing new equipment and reshuffling existing one). 

Currently not Ironman compatible.
